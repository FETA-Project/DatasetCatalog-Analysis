Flows were created using ipfixprobe flow exporter and are extended with packet metadata sequences, packet histograms, and with fields extracted from the QUIC Initial Packet, which is the first packet of the QUIC connection handshake. The extracted handshake fields are the Server Name Indication (SNI) domain, the used version of the QUIC protocol, and the user agent string that is available in a subset of QUIC communications."

* Models relying on handshake packets (first 8 packets) were more vulnerable to data drift [1][]
* Strong dependence on the 5th packet (likely containing server certificate) made models less robust [1][]
* Removing handshake packets improved stability but reduced recall scores [1][]
