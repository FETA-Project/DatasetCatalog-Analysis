description = "The dataset called CESNET-TimeSeries24 was collected by long-term monitoring of selected statistical metrics for 40 weeks for each IP address on the ISP network CESNET3 (Czech Education and Science Network). The dataset encompasses network traffic from more than 275,000 active IP addresses, assigned to a wide variety of devices, including office computers, NATs, servers, WiFi routers, honeypots, and video-game consoles found in dormitories. Moreover, the dataset is also rich in network anomaly types since it contains all types of anomalies, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection methods.\r\n"
