 * This is very large dataset. For advanced metric analysis, class count and classification performace calculation, we took only the first week (initial training window)
 * From drift analysis there are significat drifts zones also with retraining workflow (33 during the whole year in total)
 * From drift analysis there are obvious periods where F1 score goes down but no drift is detected. This is caused by big class complexity. After removing top 30 drifted classes, the overall F1 score is much more stable and retraining more reliable.
